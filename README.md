# connection-tester

I would like to create a tool to test connectivity between two computers at different location based on an IP and tcp/udp port. This application should be able to send hello packets from the transmitter to the receiver. The receiver should see the "hello" printed out on their screen which signifies a successful connection. Security and error handling consideration must be applied. Also, users should be able to have some feed back from the screen as to whether or not the connections is going through, along with a log file.
